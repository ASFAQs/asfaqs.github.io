Inject fusion tumor cells capable of producing antibodies into the abdomen of mice, allowing these cells to multiply and secrete antibodies in large numbers in the mice. 2. After a period of time, the fusion tumor cells will release a large amount of antibodies into the mouse ascites, forming the so-called \"antibody concentration ascites\". 3. Collect mouse ascites, which contains a large amount of antibodies. 4. Use purification technology such as FPLC chromatography to recover and purify the antibody to obtain high-quality antibodies for subsequent research. This whole process is an important service item in the human therapeutic antibody development platform to prepare antibodies with potential.","category":"Entered the non-exclusive core facilities of the Biomedical Translation Research Center","contact":"Chen Jialing 02-27872567","url":"https://biotrec.sinica.edu.tw/pages/2091","uuid":"SG93IGlzIG1vdXNlIGFzY2l0ZXMgYW50aWJvZHkgcHJvZHVjdGlvbiBhbmQgcHVyaWZpY2F0aW9uIHBlcmZvcm1lZD8="},{"title":"Human Therapeutic Antibody Development Platform","question":"What are the advantages of using the GH Antibody Library to develop antibodies against specific antigens?","answer":"Using the GH antibody library to develop antibodies against specific antigens has the advantages of high specificity, neutrality, low immune rejection and low side effects.
